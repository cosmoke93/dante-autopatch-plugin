"""
Dante AI Autopatch Simplified Script (Windows Friendly)

This script combines all of the components of the autopatch plugin into a single
file so you can run it directly without needing to install additional Python
packages (other than the Dante Application Library if you want real network
functionality). It works on Windows, macOS and Linux with Python 3.

How to use on Windows:

1. **Install Python**: If you don't have Python installed, download it from
   https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and follow the installer. Make
   sure to tick "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. **Download this script** and save it somewhere, e.g. on your Desktop.

3. **Open Command Prompt** (press Windows key, type `cmd`, press Enter).

4. **Navigate to the directory** containing this script. For example, if the
   script is on your Desktop, type:

       cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop

5. **Run the script**:

       python autopatch_simple.py

   The program will discover devices (simulated by default), suggest patch
   routing, and apply them (prints to the screen). If the official Dante
   Application Library (DAL) is installed and available, it will use it
   automatically.

To use the script with a real Dante network, you will need to obtain the
Dante Application Library (DAL) from Audinate. Install it in your Python
environment and adjust the import lines below accordingly【912166269295393†L148-L170】.
